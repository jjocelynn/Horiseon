## Features

Added a media screen query at the bottom of the CSS that sets a max width before the page collapses.
This allows the navigation bar to neatly rest under the h1 header at a certain width and stacks when the width is the size of a mobile device.
The media query also expands the content section and stacks the side bar right below making it easier to view on smaller screens.
